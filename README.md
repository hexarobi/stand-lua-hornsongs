# stand-lua-hornsongs

A Lua Script for the Stand mod menu for GTA5.

Spawns a car that plays a song using the vehicle horn.

# Issues

This version has the basics working, but still working to improve a few issues:

- The horn sounds are only local (not played for others online)
- If you are driving the car yourself, the horn sounds can only be very short.

# Install

Place `HornSongs.lua` into `Stand/Lua Scripts`
